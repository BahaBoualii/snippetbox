# Snippetbox

Snippetbox is a web application I built in Go while reading Alex Edwards's book "Let's Go" that allows users to paste and share text snippets. Like Pastebin or GitHub's Gists, Snippetbox provides a simple and user-friendly interface for sharing code snippets, notes, or any other text content.

## Features

- Users can create and view snippets.
- User profile management.
- User authentication and authorization for secure snippet management.
